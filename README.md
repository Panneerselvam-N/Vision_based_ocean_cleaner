# vision_based_ocean_cleaner
Clean water is a basic need for all living beings. Without water survival in the Earth is
not possible.Water covers about 70% of the Earthâ€™s surface among that only 3% of that
is pure water. Water gets polluted due to any reasons like industry waste, sewage
waste, garbage waste. Hence it is important to maintain cleanliness and hygiene of
water. We considered this water pollution as a serious issue and start to work on the
project. We decided to incorporate technology to get the work done effectively and
efficiently. Our project design is in such a way that it collects the waste which floats on
water bodies. In present time almost all the people are familiar with robots. We are
going to design a very interesting robot that is vision based ocean cleaning robot.vision systems are essential in building
a ocean cleaning robot that will complete a certain task like object detection and waste
collection. Object detection and training is a vast, vibrant and yet inconclusive
and complex area of the computer vision. In this proposed work, convolutional
neural network are used to develop a model which is composed of multiple
layers to classify the given objects into any of the defined classes.

## Status:

### STEP 1: Waste segregation  (Completed)
We have classified upto 7 categories of objects which are floating above ocean.
Categories:
Waste : Plastics, Tyres, Woods, Combined(combination of all)\
Non-waste: Ship, Person, Fish.

### STEP 2: Waste Detection  (working)
### STEP 3: Robot designing
